# Tip Calculator Application

## Topics Applied

- **DOM Manipulation**: 
  - Utilized `document.querySelector()` to select and interact with HTML elements (`.total_amount`, `.tip_amount`, and `.tip_button`) for retrieving user input and handling the button click.
  
- **Event Handling**: 
  - Attached an event listener using `addEventListener()` to the tip button, which triggers the calculation of the total bill when clicked.
  
- **Type Conversion**: 
  - Used `parseFloat()` to convert the input values from strings to numbers in order to perform arithmetic calculations.

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Calculated the tip amount based on the user input, and added it to the meal amount to display the total bill.

## Summary

This project implements a basic tip calculator using JavaScript by taking the meal amount and tip percentage as inputs, calculating the tip, and displaying the total bill.
