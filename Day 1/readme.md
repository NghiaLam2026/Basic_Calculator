# Basic Calculator Application

## Topics Applied

- **DOM Manipulation**: 
  - Used `document.querySelector()` to select and interact with HTML elements (`.first_number`, `.second_number`, `.operators`, and `.submit_button`) for retrieving user input and handling the button click.
  
- **Event Handling**: 
  - Attached an event listener using `addEventListener()` to the submit button, which triggers the calculator function when clicked.
  
- **Conditional Statements**: 
  - Implemented `if-else` statements to check the selected operator and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
  
- **Type Conversion**: 
  - Used `Number()` to convert the input values from strings to numbers for accurate arithmetic calculations.

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user-selected operator.

## Summary

This project is a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) from the user, performs the operation, and displays the result using an alert.
